# SHPoid
.shp file editor for the old C&amp;C games

I've put this off for far too long and tried making it in many different frameworks often succumbing to analysis paralysis. This is instead a proof of concept to show that I can create something in .Net and I can finish something as well as creating something valuable for the C&C modding community at the same time, one that has given so much and expected so little in return.
